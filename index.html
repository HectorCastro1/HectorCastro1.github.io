        <div class="subheading mb-5"> Theatre, Film and Digital Production MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a current University of Riverside, California student working on my Bachelor's Degree in the Theatre, Film and Digital Production major with a concentration in Film Making. I come from Los Angeles County where I was born and raised by Immigrant Parents. Growing up, I liked to follow in the footsteps of my older siblings, both of whom now have full-time jobs. My Older brother attended California State University, Los Angeles where he earned his Bachleors and Masters Degree in Mechanical Engineering and later worked for Raytheon, a U.S. defense contractor and industrial corporation. My older sister attended California State University, Dominguez Hills where she earned her Bachelor's in Teaching and became an AP Stats teacher for the Los Angeles Unified School DIstrict. As a younger sibling, I had dreams of becoming one of these two dreams but at the end of the day filming and creating videos became my passion.
<br><br>

        During my time when I was enrolled in High School, I started becoming more interested in creating videos to upload to YouTube. In my Freshman year, I started experimenting with creating video memes by adding still images onto other videos. I used current events to try to become popular but at the end of the day, my Youtube channel didnâ€™t gain much attraction other than my friends. During my Sophomore year, I learned to create small animation in which I made still images move around the screen but it still made it look unprofessional. Finally, it wasnâ€™t until my Junior year in school when I took a Video Production class. I learned multiple filming techniques as well as editing techniques to help enhance my video skills. From there, I took the advanced class during my Senior year to take these skills and apply them to the real world. Our class manages the SV Dons Media Channel in which we would record school events, sports, clubs, and dances and post them on Youtube for the whole school to view. We used different techniques for different videos to get the most out of them and to catch our audiences attention.
<br><br>

        My time in High School wasnâ€™t just dedicated to school work and sports. It was also dedicated to helping to volunteer at school events, sports management and also community service events. I joined our schoolâ€™s Leo Club and Key Club to help me find events that I can volunteer for and gain experiences. For the most part, the events that I volunteered for were to help set up for a marathon, hand out water, sell items, collect equipment and so on. Most of the joy out of these events came after they had ended, which is when my friends and I would go hang out at a nearby place and just have some fun. Overall, joining these clubs has helped me a lot when it comes to my socialization. Growing up, I was usually quiet when it came to people that werenâ€™t my friends, but now that I have learned how to talk to new people, it has helped me become more confident in my communication abilities.
